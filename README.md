Gearticks-IMU-MARG
==================

Repo for MARG/IMU arduino files we develop

####Prerequisites:
  - Download the files [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/MPU-9150_Breakout)
  - Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/MPU-9150_Breakout/tree/master/firmware)

> To use the library, copy both I2Cdev and MPU6050 into your libraries folder in your main Arduino directory. If you don't have a folder called libraries, create one and drop both files in there. Now you can goto the example sketch named MPU9150_raw (in MPU6050 -> Examples), open and run the main .ino file.

###FAQ:

 - MY SERIAL MONITOR IS GIBBERISH!!
     - Set its frequency to 38400 baud
